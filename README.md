# TetrisJS
This is tetris made in JS  
It has some cool features such as:  
* brick editor
* modifiers: fire, steel, ice and glue
* 6 different game modes
* animated game instructions
* recursive gravity
* ghost brick
* moving with arrows

**You can even play it on your phone**
  
I suggest you watch the "how to play" section before playing
